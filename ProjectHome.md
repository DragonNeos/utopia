What Utopia wont do/wont feature:

- Utopia is not meant to run Sony's code, thus current homebrews or games wont run on it.
- Utopia will not feature UMD drive support of any kind.
- Utopia will not feature any kind of DRM functionalities (at least this is not planned)
- Utopia will most likely not feature any kirk engine support.
- Wlan is planned but not a priority at this point.
- No vsh or graphic interface of any kind is to be included in utopia or officially supported by the utopia project. Utopia is ONLY the kernel
